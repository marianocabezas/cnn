# CNN nolearn
Repository with CNN code base on Lasagne and nolearn. While I am still working on it, I ~~will~~ might migrate all my code to the cnn-keras repository soon. I will most likely drop any development on this repository as well.

Since all the experimental stuff is merged in master and I don't plan on changing anything from this repository, I'm moving to a new one based on Keras. I will work on updating the README on the future.
